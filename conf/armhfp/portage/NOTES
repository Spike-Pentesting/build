- Files in here must be real file, hardlinks or directories
(containing split files, like for instance, package.use/
which contains 00-sabayon.package.use).

Symlinks are not allowed since they're read by Entropy Server
during repository metadata generation and, if symlink, their
symlink pointer is recorded instead of the file content.

Split files in configuration directories, like package.use/*
must end with "." + the directory name. For instance, configuration
files inside package.use/ must end with ".package.use". This is
required in order to have them pulled in properly into
packages.db.meta by Entropy Server.
